# ReactJS shopping task

This project represents the task supplied by DREIDEV and the following represents the restrictions applied and the ones that have not been applied with justification next to each of them:
* You may use a framework of your choosing 
  * ReactJS is the library used for the implementation alongside with redux and the ducks bundling structure [click here](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux)
* Vanilla JS is better, jQuery is worse
  * Pure JS has been used without JQuery
* Please don't use any extra libraries if you can. (no bootstrap, it's not worth it)
  * This restriction was violated due to the need for using Bootstrap panels
* The design should be responsive (as shown in the design link)
  * Check 
* You should use ES6+ Javascript Features, all modern browsers support ES Modules and async/await
  * ES6 features are apparent through arrow functions, const, and so on.
